#### üìå How the project works

1. Press **Run** button or **^R** in Intellij IDEA
2. Open two new windows in your browser
3. Type in first window: http://localhost:8080/user
4. Type in second window: http://localhost:8080/alert
5. In the **email** field and **retype email**, enter the email address to which you can receive the activation code 
for the test. It should be noted 
that at this stage a simple check for empty fields has been implemented. If you leave some field empty 
or the fields do not match or enter an email that is already in the database, you will receive a 
corresponding message
6. Go to http://localhost:8080/alert and in the **Check email** field enter the email you entered earlier, click 
the **Check info** button. You will receive information about your mail and status. 
7. Press the **RESET** button
8. Go to the first tab, in the **Email** field, enter your mail, in the **Activation code** field, 
enter the code that was sent to the mail. It should be noted that there is a check for the correctness of 
the entered activation code, which was received earlier. If you entered all the data correctly, confirmed your 
mail with an activation code, you will receive an email with congratulations on successfully adding to the database.
9. Go to the second tab, make sure that the data in the **INFORMATION** block is reset, if you see information 
from the previous steps, click the **Reset** button
10. In the **Check email** field, enter the email from the first steps and click the **Check info** button. 
You can see information about the status of the mail confirmation, and a detailed description of the errors 
if there are problems with the email confirmation
